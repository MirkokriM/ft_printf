## Project Description

The `ft_printf` function is designed to print formatted output to the standard output (stdout) or a specified file stream. It supports a subset of the format specifiers provided by the standard `printf` function, including `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, and `%X`. This means that it can handle printing characters, strings, pointers, integers (both signed and unsigned), and hexadecimal values.

## How to Use

To use the `ft_printf` function, you need to include the `ft_printf.h` header file in your source code. This header file contains the function prototype for `ft_printf` and any necessary definitions or declarations.

The `ft_printf` function has a similar interface to the standard `printf` function. It takes a format string as its first argument, followed by any additional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers in the format string. The function then processes the format string and prints the formatted output to the standard output.

For example, you can use the `ft_printf` function as follows:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main(void) {
    ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    ft_printf("The value of x is %d\n", 42);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the first `ft_printf` call prints "Hello, world!" to the standard output, while the second `ft_printf` call prints "The value of x is 42". The `%s` and `%d` format specifiers are used to indicate that a string and an integer value should be inserted into the format string, respectively.

## Supported Format Specifiers

The `ft_printf` function supports the following format specifiers:

- `%c`: Prints a single character.
- `%s`: Prints a null-terminated string.
- `%p`: Prints the memory address of a pointer.
- `%d` and `%i`: Prints a signed decimal integer.
- `%u`: Prints an unsigned decimal integer.
- `%x` and `%X`: Prints an unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase or uppercase, respectively).

## Limitations and Known Issues

The `ft_printf` function in this project does not include all the advanced features and edge cases that are present in the standard `printf` function. It is a simplified version with a limited set of format specifiers and options. The following are some limitations and known issues of this implementation:

- Floating-point numbers are not supported.
- Width and precision modifiers are not fully implemented.
- Certain edge cases, such as very large or very small numbers, may not be handled correctly.
- Error handling and robustness measures are minimal or absent.

## Further Improvements

Although this project implements a basic version of `printf`, there are several areas where further improvements can be made, including:

- Adding support for more format specifiers and options.
- Implementing width and precision modifiers to control the field width and precision of the printed output.
- Enhancing the error handling and robustness of the function to handle edge cases and invalid input.
- Optimizing the performance of the function to improve efficiency and reduce memory usage.

## Conclusion

The `ft_printf` project is a simplified implementation of the `printf` function that provides a subset of its functionality. It can be used to format and print output in a similar way as the standard `printf`
